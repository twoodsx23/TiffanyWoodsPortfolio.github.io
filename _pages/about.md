I have spent over a decade of my professional life supporting all the of the stages of the software development life cycle with a focus on acceptance testing, delivery, and implementation.

The best part of being a Product Owner is the ability to simplify complex concepts and/or processes, engaging my stakeholders throughout the process to deliver features and services that delight both internal and external users.

I am currently studying data science so that I can leverage those principals and tools to help me make more informed product decisions.
